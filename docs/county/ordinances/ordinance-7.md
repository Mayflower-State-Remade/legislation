        1. Upon the declaration of an emergency, all members of these departments will be considered to hold a temporary deputisation within the Sheriff’s Office, thereby granted the right to exercise their law enforcement power on any land which the county encompasses, for the duration of the emergency.
        2. At such time as an emergency is no longer in effect, the temporary deputisation will cease to be in effect and all affected municipal officers will no longer have the right to enforce law outside their municipal jurisdiction, except where other county, or state law applies.

            2. A second county commissioner signing the order declaring a county emergency
            3. If the provisions of (b.i)1.a or (b.i)1.b are fulfilled, then the emergency will go on until such time as the emergency is declared over.
